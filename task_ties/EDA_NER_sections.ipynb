We report all the cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2004. We developed a protocol for data collection that included the following: medical history, triggers, signs, radiology, treatment, hospital stay, and complications. During this period we diagnosed 36 cases-25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%)-with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years) and a mean hospital stay of 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days).

We report all the cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2004. We developed a protocol for data collection that included the following: medical history, triggers, signs, radiology, treatment, hospital stay, and complications. During this period we diagnosed 36 cases-25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%)-with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years) and a mean hospital stay of 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days). The most common clinical presentation was chest pain, either isolated (27%) or with associated dyspnea (19.4%). A triggering factor was identified for 14 patients (38.8%). There was no associated morbidity or mortality. In view of our findings, we concluded that spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon entity with considerable clinical variability and that correct diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion.
